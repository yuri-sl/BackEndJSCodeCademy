//Example Tests

describe("setPlayerMoves() - Main Functionality", function () {
  // this is a `describe` block, everything within this callback function is one test suite
  afterEach(clearMoves); // this is a `hook` that gets called between `it` blocks to reset the state

  it("a function called setPlayerMoves should exist", function () {
    // this is an `it` block, everything inside this function is a single test case
    should.equal(typeof setPlayerMoves, "function"); // tests often start by checking that the right things exist and are of the right type
  });

  it("should set player one's moves with valid inputs", function () {
    setPlayerMoves("Player One", "rock", 11); // here we call a function from the code we are testing that sets play one's move to rock with a value of 11

    should.equal(playerOneMoveOneType, "rock"); // this is an assertion that tests that after the `setPlayerMoves()` function above is called, playerOneMoveOneType should equal `rock`
    should.equal(playerOneMoveOneValue, 11); // this assertion tests that setPlayerMoves can set the value of playerOneMoveOneValue
  });
